The **URI** or **requestTarget** in an HTTP request can take various forms depending on the type of request and the server configuration. Below is a list of different types of URIs or requestTargets that a request can have:

---

### **1. Absolute Path**
- The most common form of a requestTarget.
- Specifies the path to a resource on the server.
- Example:
  ```
  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
  GET /static/image.jpg HTTP/1.1
  GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **2. Root Path**
- Refers to the root of the server.
- Example:
  ```
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **3. Query Parameters**
- Includes a `?` followed by key-value pairs for filtering or passing data.
- Example:
  ```
  GET /search?q=example HTTP/1.1
  GET /api/v1/users?role=admin&active=true HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **4. Fragment Identifier**
- Includes a `#` followed by a fragment identifier (used client-side, not sent to the server).
- Example:
  ```
  GET /docs/index.html#section2 HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **5. Absolute URI**
- Includes the full URI with scheme, host, and path.
- Typically used in proxy requests.
- Example:

  GET https://api.example.com/v1/users HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

  OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
  ```

- Includes percent-encoded characters for special symbols.
- Example:
  ```
  GET /search?q=hello%20world HTTP/1.1
  GET /api/v1/users%3Frole%3Dadmin HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **9. Dynamic Paths**
- Includes placeholders or variables in the path (used in REST APIs).
- Example:
  ```
  GET /api/v1/users/{id} HTTP/1.1

  ```
  GET /static/css/style.css HTTP/1.1
  GET /static/js/app.js HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **12. API Endpoints**
- Refers to RESTful API endpoints.
- Example:
  ```
  GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
  POST /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
  DELETE /api/v1/users/123 HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **13. WebSocket Upgrade**
- Used for WebSocket handshake requests.
- Example:
  ```
  GET /chat HTTP/1.1
  Upgrade: websocket
  ```

---

  GET /api/v1/users/123/orders/456 HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **19. Paths with Trailing Slash**
- Includes a trailing slash at the end of the path.
- Example:
  ```
  GET /static/ HTTP/1.1
  GET /api/v1/users/ HTTP/1.1

---

### **20. Paths with Special Characters**
- Includes special characters in the path.
- Example:
  ```
  GET /search?q=hello+world HTTP/1.1
  GET /api/v1/users?name=O'Reilly HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

### **Summary**
The `requestTarget` can take various forms, including:
- Absolute paths (`/index.html`)
- Query parameters (`/search?q=example`)
- Absolute URIs (`http://example.com/index.html`)
- CGI script paths (`/cgi-bin/script.cgi`)
- REST API endpoints (`/api/v1/users`)
- Special forms like `*` (used for `OPTIONS` requests).

The exact format depends on the type of request and the server configuration.
